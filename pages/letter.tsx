			<p className="pb-3">Dear Grade Melon Community, </p>
			<p className="py-3 indent-6">
				Many of you have noticed that the recent Synergy (including StudentVue)
				upgrades affected Grade Melon&apos;s functionality. This is especially
				frustrating as we approach the quarter&apos;s end. Although I understand the
				urgency of this citation, I regret to inform you that the new system
				seems completely different, making a quick solution unlikely. While I&apos;m
				dedicating time to understanding the new system and exploring potential
				solutions, as a graduating senior I cannot guarantee a fix before I
				graduate.{" "}
			</p>
			<p className="py-3 indent-6">
				Despite the current challenge, I wanted to take a moment to celebrate
				our incredible journey! Back in October 2022, Grade Melon was just a
				seed of an idea. Countless hours were spent meticulously
				reverse-engineering, designing the user interface, and bringing it all
				to life with colors, animations, and functionality. By December, it was
				gaining traction. We saw 300 users visiting in a single day! Since then,
				the growth has been phenomenal – over 1.2 million unique visitors have
				used the app, spending an average of 2.5 minutes each. During peak
				times, daily visits skyrocketed, reaching a record 12.8k on January
				25th, 2024. These numbers are a reflection of the incredible community
				that has embraced Grade Melon, and for that, I am truly grateful.{" "}
			</p>
			<p className="py-3 indent-6">
				To every single Grade Melon user, thank you. Your trust, your
				enthusiasm, and your sheer number have fueled my passion for this
				project. It has been an absolute privilege to create something that has
				made a positive impact on our community. While the future of Grade Melon
				with the new system is uncertain, the community remains strong. I want
				to remind all of you, that Grade Melon started off as a risk. I poured
				countless hours into the app, not knowing if it would actually pay off.
				But it did. So, I want to inspire all of you to take risks, step outside
				of your comfort zone, and strive for change. As Gandhi said, &quot;Be the
				change you want to see in the world.&quot;{" "}
